### ChromeVox

useful for testing website with screen reader

### Increase accessibility with aria attributes

some examples like `role`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-popup`

### Control without mouse

make component usable without mouse (keyboard only) with key press events such as `onKeyDown` listener

for example a select component can open a panel when its clicked, and also open the panel when down arrow key is pressed

another thing is controlling where the focus is, for example when the panel of a select is open, focus should move to the item inside panel, and user should be able to change which element to focus with their keyboard
